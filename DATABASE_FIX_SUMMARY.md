# Database Compatibility Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was experiencing 500 Internal Server Error when trying to update bookings (assign bookings to hotels) due to database compatibility issues between SQLite and PostgreSQL.

## Root Cause
The codebase was originally written for SQLite but deployed with PostgreSQL. The main issues were:

1. **Parameter Placeholders**: SQLite uses `?` placeholders while PostgreSQL uses `$1, $2, $3` format
2. **SQL Syntax Differences**: Some SQL functions and syntax were SQLite-specific
3. **INSERT OR REPLACE**: SQLite syntax not supported in PostgreSQL

## Files Fixed

### 1. server/routes/bookings.js
- âœ… Fixed all SQLite `?` placeholders to PostgreSQL `$1, $2, $3` format
- âœ… Updated dynamic parameter counting for UPDATE queries
- âœ… Fixed overlapping booking checks
- âœ… Fixed audit log insertions
- âœ… Fixed available apartments query

### 2. server/routes/users.js
- âœ… Fixed user update queries
- âœ… Fixed user deletion queries
- âœ… Fixed password reset queries
- âœ… Fixed audit log insertions

### 3. server/routes/backup.js
- âœ… Fixed backup metadata insertions
- âœ… Replaced `INSERT OR REPLACE` with `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`
- âœ… Fixed user import queries
- âœ… Fixed audit log cleanup with PostgreSQL date functions
- âœ… Updated SQLite-specific datetime functions to PostgreSQL equivalents

## Key Changes Made

### Parameter Placeholder Conversion
```sql
-- Before (SQLite)
SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE id = ?

-- After (PostgreSQL)
SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE id = $1
```

### Dynamic Parameter Handling
```javascript
// Before
updateFields.push('guest_name = ?');

// After
updateFields.push(`guest_name = $${paramCount}`);
paramCount++;
```

### INSERT OR REPLACE Conversion
```sql
-- Before (SQLite)
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO apartments (id, name, properties)
VALUES (?, ?, ?)

-- After (PostgreSQL)
INSERT INTO apartments (id, name, properties)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
name = EXCLUDED.name,
properties = EXCLUDED.properties
```

### Date/Time Functions
```sql
-- Before (SQLite)
WHERE timestamp < datetime('now', '-' || ? || ' days')

-- After (PostgreSQL)
WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '$1 days'
```

## Testing Status
- âœ… Build successful
- âœ… All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- âœ… Changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- ðŸ”„ Deployment will automatically update on Render

## Expected Resolution
The booking assignment functionality should now work correctly without 500 errors. Users should be able to:
- Assign bookings to apartments
- Update booking details
- View booking information
- Perform all CRUD operations on bookings

## Deployment
The fixes have been pushed to the main branch and will be automatically deployed to:
- **Production URL**: https://dentalsuite-rental-manager.onrender.com

The deployment should complete within 5-10 minutes of the push.
